          <h4>Cheating</h4>

          <h4>Password Sharing Sites</h4>

          <p className="f_a">All payments are made in US Dollars. Payments are made every two weeks by check, Paxum, ACH (for US webmasters) and wire transfers (for non-US webmasters). <br />

          <h4>Trial Memberships</h4>

          <h4>Restrictions on Paid Inclusion Advertising</h4>

          <p>You are not permitted to register or bid on a Gunzblazing paysite name or other phrases or marks used by Gunzblazing (collectively the Gunzblazing Marks) with any paid inclusion search engine provider including but not limited to Google and MSN. This includes separating the Gunzblazing Marks into individual words, for example the domain "www.hotbarebacking.com" into "hot barebacking". This also includes any variants, misspellings or derivatives which are clearly designed to imitate a Gunzblazing Mark, such as "Gunsblazing" or "hotbearbacking." Doing so will result in withholding of payouts and termination of your Gunzblazing account without compensation. If you are uncertain of what these terms or words are you should ask your account representative.</p>

          <p>To be eligible for the Sign-On Bonus you are not permitted to register a URL, company, address, beneficiary or account contact that is currently registered with Gunzblazing.com unless approved in writing by the Program Manager.</p>

          <p>Upon termination of this agreement or our request, all material related to Gunzblazing must be removed from your sites.</p>
